# Whisper Manager

Largely inspired by **WoW Instant Messenger (WIM)**, but seeks to expand upon it with added features and fixes. It's a powerful addon for people who whisper frequently. It stores history far longer than other chat addons while reducing data bloat to keep your game running fast. 

**Unique Features**
- Global chat history.
- Recent chat list (catch up on messages you missed).
- Emote/OOC highlighting (for the RP community).
- Resize text font.
- Resize input (editbox) font.
- Easily search player history.
- Movable windows and buttons that remember their **position*- across all your characters. No fuss needed.
- Expanding input box (see your full messages before sending).
- Advanced data retention (recent & long-term **history**).

**Other Features**
- **UI and font scaling**
- Copy chat button.
- Link highlighting.
- Windows taskbar icon flash (on unread **message**).
- **Customizable message colors.**
- **Notification*- sound.
- Resize window/position.
- Change font.
- **Spell-check*- support.

**Roadmap/Future**
- Better TRP3 support.
- Themes/window coloring. Art maybe?
- Performance optimization and bug fixes.
- Deleting a specific user's history.
- Clearing recent chat history manually.
