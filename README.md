# Whisper Manager
Addon inspired by WoW Instant Messenger (WIM), but seeks to expand upon it with added features and fixes. It's a powerful addon for people who whisper frequently. It stores history far longer than other chat addons while reducing data bloat to keep your game running fast.

- Recent chat list.
- Missed whisper pop-ups on login. 
- Emote/OOC highlighting (for the RP community).
- Resize text font.
- Resize input (editbox) font.
- Easily search player history.
- Movable windows and buttons that remember their position - across all your characters. No fuss needed.
- Expanding input box (see your full messages before sending).
- Advanced data retention (recent & long-term history).

Other Features
- UI and font scaling
- Copy chat button.
- Easy URL copying.

Roadmap/Future
