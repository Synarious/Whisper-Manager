# Whisper Manager
Addon inspired by WoW Instant Messenger (WIM), but seeks to expand upon it with added features and fixes. It's a powerful addon for people who whisper frequently. It stores history far longer than other chat addons while reducing data bloat to keep your game running fast.

Unique Features
- Global chat history.
- Recent chat list (catch up on messages you missed).
- Emote/OOC highlighting (for the RP community).
- Resize text font.
- Resize input (editbox) font.
- Easily search player history.
- Movable windows and buttons that remember their position - across all your characters. No fuss needed.
- Expanding input box (see your full messages before sending).
- Advanced data retention (recent & long-term history).

Other Features
- UI and font scaling
- Copy chat button.
- Link highlighting.
- Windows taskbar icon flash (on unread message).
- Customizable message colors.
- Notification sounds.
- Resize window/position.
- Change font.
- Mispelled Support

Roadmap/Future
- Better TRP3 support.
- Themes/window coloring. Art maybe?
- Performance optimization and bug fixes.
- Deleting a specific user's history.
- Clearing recent chat history manually.
- Midnight support - Will be complicated, but worst case appears addon may not work within combat/dungeons.
